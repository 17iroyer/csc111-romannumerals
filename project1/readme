Known bugs: -the respective converters will only work if the correct input is entered
                ->if an Arabic number is entered to the Roman converter, the output will be "0"
                ->if a Roman number is entered to the Arabic converter, the output will be "I"
            -each converter will only work with numbers from 1-4999
                ->this is because the roman numeral for 5000 cannot be represented on a computer
            -the Roman converter will only work if the input is a correctly written Roman numeral
                ->e.g. do not subtract a number that is more than 10 times greater
